This Supplementary Information reports convergence studies of the G$_0$W$_0$ calculations of the vertical ionization potential of the CH$_4$ molecule, whcih is taken as a representative example of the molecular systems studied in the main text.

\section*{$G_0W_0$ calculations of the vertical ionization potential of the methane molecule}
\subsection{Eigenvalues of the symmetrized \textit{irreducible} density-density response function}
In \autoref{fig:compare_eigenvals}, we  compare eigenvalues for the symmetrized irreducible density-density response function of the methane molecule: 500 stdPDEPs and 100 stdPDEPs +  400 kinPDEPs. On the scale of the figure the results are indistinguishable.

\subsection{Calculations of the vertical ionization potential}
We present, in \autoref{fig:different_number_of_PDEPs}, the results for the vertical ionization potential of the $\mathrm{CH_4}$ molecule computed with 5, 10, 20 standard PDEPs ($N_\mathrm{stdPDEP}$), and the remaining 100, 200, 300 and 400 PDEPs treated as kinetic PDEPs. When setting $N_\mathrm{stdPDEP}$ = 10 or 20 we obtain results accurate within 0.02 eV, as compared to the ones obtained using only standard PDEP. When using 5 stdPDEPs we obtain instead an error more than 10 times larger (0.25 eV).

\subsection{Interpolation of results}
In this work, the computed energy levels  were  interpolated with respect to the total number of PDEPs,
\begin{equation}
    E = a + \frac{b}{N_\mathrm{stdPDEP}+N_\mathrm{kinPDEP}},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the converged energy level and $b$ is an arbitrary number depending on the system.

In \autoref{fig:interpolation_from20}, we show results for the vertical ionization potential  of the methane molecule with respect to the total number of PDEPs included in the calculation: 20 stdPDEPs were used followed by 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 kinPDEPs. We note that as the number of  kinPDEPs increases, one obtains energies similar to those computed with stdPDEPs; in addition the proportionality between energies and the inverse of the total number of PDEPs holds even when the total number of PDEPs in small.
